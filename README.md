# AsciiDoc Plugin

This plugin is used to view and edit [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/) files and formatted blocks.

It uses the [AsciiDoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) js library: [asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js: :scroll: A JavaScript port of Asciidoctor, a modern implementation of AsciiDoc](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js)

## STATUS

Check out [dzruyk/obsidian-asciidoc: Obsidian asciidoc editor plugin](https://github.com/dzruyk/obsidian-asciidoc/), it's a fuller feature set and it works!
